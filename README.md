# AI Image Transformation Application

## Project Overview

[![.github/workflows/pyton-ci.yml](https://github.com/lurldgbodex/ai-magery/actions/workflows/pyton-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lurldgbodex/ai-magery/actions/workflows/pyton-ci.yml)

This project is an AI-powered application that allows users to upload images and generate new images based on specific modifications. The AI will process the images to produce variations, such as generating corporate attire versions, modifying facial features, and changing the background while retaining appearance.

## Features

- **Image Transformation:** Generate modified images using AI.
- **Customization:** Modify elements such as attire, background, and facial hair.
- **High-Quality Output:** Ensure the generated images maintain facial resemblance.
- **Scalable Processing:** Built with Celery for handling multiple tasks concurrently.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Celery
- **AI Model:** Stable Diffusion
- **Frontend (Future):** React (will be added later)
- **Database (Optional):** TBD, for storing user-uploaded images and processed results.
- **Containerization:** Docker (future setup)

## Initial Roadmap

1. **Initial Setup** (Current phase)

   - Set up the Python backend using FastAPI.
   - Implement basic image processing using Stable Diffusion.
   - Set up Celery for background task processing.

2. **Basic Functionality**

   - Create endpoints for image upload and processing.
   - Set up background task processing for image modifications.

3. **Scaling and Optimization**

   - Add Docker for containerization.
   - Integrate a scalable queuing system with Celery and Redis.
   - Build out React frontend for user interaction.

4. **Advanced Features**

   - Add real-time processing feedback.
   - Support additional image transformations.

5. **Frontend Development**
   - Set up the React frontend to allow user interaction with the backend API.
